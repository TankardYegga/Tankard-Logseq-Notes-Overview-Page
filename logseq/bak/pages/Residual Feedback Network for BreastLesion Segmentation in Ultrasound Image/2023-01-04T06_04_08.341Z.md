	- 此处Unet的encoder-decoder的子结构都发生了修改：
		- encoder是连续的五层，第一个encoder只有1个7*7的卷积，后面四个encoder分别是3、4、6、3个连续的双卷积结构；
		- decoder是连续的四层

	- 残差表示模块：
		- [[#blue]]==每个残差单元都包含一个3*3的卷积层和上采样，使得三个连续的decoder经过这三个残差单元之后都输出大小同为 256 * 256 的特征图。这三个特征图按照通道方向进行连接，最后再经过若干卷积层，就得到了最终的残差表示图。==[[#green]]==残差表示图可以利用初始分割结果和GT的差（也就是残差mask）来进行监督==。[[#red]]==残差表示图可以帮忙定位出：模糊/丢失 的边缘  + 难以区分的区域==

	- Analyzing the pathological status from breast microcalcifications in mammograms is very challenging because of tiny and shape-variant lesions. The current state-of-the-art approaches rely on radiomics-based machine learning and deep learning methods. However, the former is time-consuming, and the latter tends to underfit due to the small size of the medical dataset. Recently, decision fusion in ensemble deep learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, but the existing fusion strategies still lack interpretability and operational simplicity. In this paper, a multi-group similarity-decoding-based weighted fusion mechanism, dubbed MG-SDWFM, is proposed, which is an adaption of vanilla weighted averaging. We divide all individual features into multiple groups according to the position and execute fusion only within the group. In the fusion process, a shared latent embedding $L$ is introduced to represent the most essential features for classification. With the help of the inner product, the similarity between $L$ and each vectorized feature is calculated and the relative importance of different features is then obtained in the form of weights. Additionally, we add an auxiliary output for each model to provide supervision and devise a multi-output loss to help the model train. The experimental results on the in-house dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed over other state-of-the-art methods, achieving an AUC of 0.885.
