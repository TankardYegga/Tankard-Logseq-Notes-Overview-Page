title:: Evaluation of Graph Topological Features in Digitized Mammogram for Microcalcification Cluster Classification. DICTA 2018: 1-7

- In this paper, the scale-specific graph topological changes of Microcalcifications (MC) were investigated to classify MC cluster. A series of multi-scale MC cluster graphs were generated based on the connectivity of individual MCs. The extracted features from the graph series were integrated with the statistical and morphological characteristics of MC clusters. Subsequent feature selection showed that the features related to the denseness of MC cluster at some specific scales of the generated graphs discriminated better than all other features in classifying MC clusters while using an ensemble classifier with 10-fold cross validation. The proposed method was evaluated using two well-known digitized datasets: MIAS (Mammographic Image Analysis Society) and DDSM (The Digital Database for Screening Mammography). High classification accuracy (around 98%) and good ROC (receiver operating characteristic) results (area under the ROC curve up to 0.99) were achieved.
- 在本文中，**研究了微钙化（MC）的尺度特定图拓扑变化以对MC簇进行分类。 基于单个 MC 的连通性生成了一系列多尺度 MC 集群图。 从图系列中提取的特征与 MC 簇的统计和形态特征相结合**。 随后的特征选择表明，在使用具有 10 倍交叉验证的集成分类器时，在生成的图的某些特定尺度上，与 MC 簇的密集度相关的特征在对 MC 簇进行分类时比所有其他特征更好地区分。 使用两个著名的数字化数据集对所提出的方法进行了评估：MIAS（乳腺摄影图像分析协会）和 DDSM（用于筛查乳腺摄影的数字数据库）。 实现了高分类精度（约 98%）和良好的 ROC（接收器操作特性）结果（ROC 曲线下面积高达 0.99）。
