	- Uncle, you are the guy who is most masculine that I have ever met.  You are predominantly a tough guy, but you are also full of tenderness. You grapple with the hardships alone. You are with great masculinity to overcome all these. I have a bit of verbal sexism, but my words and my proses are not clumsy again after meeting you. It's not right to think of women as a side issue just because Eve was fashioned from Adam's rib, so it's also not proper to ignore your loneliness just because you were reborn on the way to pursue wealth. In this age of advocating emancipation, there is no fault for any form of emotional relationship. You are the divine godfather that provides salvation for my body and my soul. You are the proprietor, I am just your house, and you furnish me with a variety of loving styles. You are the insider, I am the laypeople, and you lead me to the door hand-in-hand. You are the painter who likes describing things with a broad brush, and I am the artist who enjoys outlining and sketching with a detailed stroke. You are the wooden stick that pulls me out of the quagmire that I am mired in for a long time. Your world seems to be inaccessible with lots of technicality or legalese, but I just knock it out with tongue-in-cheek words showing love and care. You are like a big-boned, rain-drenched puppy that needs a raised umbrella to hide you from the rain. I have to declare, many sentences that I sent you on the phone are in a figurative sense, not the literal meaning, and how I wish you could understand that point. I will never prescribe your behavior like a controlling mom because I hope we can illuminate each other and provide each other with the warmth that can at least sustain our existence. Uncle, this is all my heart, warm and pure, can you feel it beating? Will you let me get to know your comfort and belief system? Will you point out the thinking and behavior that limiting me?
	- Uncle, you are just a boon to my life full of spiritual loneliness, just like spring rains are a boon to the farmers who expect a good harvest, just like guided dogs are a boon to the partially sighted, just like the seawater is a boon to various types of marine creatures. The cell phone got wet was the bane of my yesterday's unhappiness, but not being able to see you is the bane of my today's sorrow. It doesn't matter that we just keep our affair clandestine. Have you noticed my surreptitious kisses and glances when you fall asleep? Can you imagine that kind of excited and nervous joy when I will make a surreptitious visit to you tomorrow night? Uncle, you just strike me as an affable sort of man, and I guess I just strike you as a poor and firm-eyed boy. You must be amiable to everyone around you, and I believe, where there is you, there is an amiable mood that you will render to the whole environment. You always behave in a genial manner even on things like folding the bath towel.  It seems that we are similar in personality, that is, we are both not so gregarious.
	- Uncle, I have got used to austere life, which means I could just live with things that are absolutely necessary.  I guess you also can resonate with this kind of austerity. Uncle, I hope you can upbraid me for being unmotivated sometimes, so I will never be an outdated commodity in society. Do you know what? I always imagined that I could have a healthy relationship with guys like you,  but my supposition is that only when I become really excellent someone can come out. You are an auspicious beginning to the second half of the year 2022. You will never become obsolete in my heart, even when you get older.  I guess uncle you don't believe the so-called solemn pledge of love, and I don't believe too. But at this moment is genuinely true.
	- Uncle, my roommate just castigated me for not having a dinner party with them. Do you know how I feel nostalgia for the old days when we can get along with each other with peace of mind?  There are so many conjectures about our conflicts spreading through the campus gossip. Uncle, it's not a propitious time to share all my secrets with you, because I have to overcome my morose period of worrying about the future. I have to find the positive aspects of the seemingly despondent situation. Only the brave can break the impasse, and there is no dead end for anyone who dares to practice. Uncle, conspicuously, we'll be parting, reuniting, parting, and reuniting in the not too distant future. I pledge my love to you, and I could never belie my longing for you. Your words with wisdom indeed enlighten me, and mitigate my inner restlessness. Your warm pats on my shoulder mollify me when I make awkward moves and get upset, and I believe the youthful breath in me will mollify you when you get angry for trivia at work. Switching restaurants could assuage your unpleasant emotions for the noisy dieting environment. You are the most coveted pearl for jewelers, you are the most coveted Noble Prize for scientists, you are the most coveted plum for thirsty walkers in the dessert, you are the most coveted lighthouse for sailors sailing around the sea, and you are the most coveted man for me. You have some common attractions of men like the appetite of protection, but you are the very antithesis in behavior pattern. Most of men are impetuous, but you are antithetical to consider things comprehensively and detailed;  most of men are irresponsible for their behaviors especially those are potential to ruin their reputations, but you are antithetical to be inclusive to accept all the natural occurrences and choices. Uncle,  our meeting is as amazing as the antipodal poles of the earth being tunneled by a pair of macroscopic hand blessed by the god of fate. The chance of our collision lies that we are both not aloof and are true to instinct ideas. Uncle, you say you develop a bad temper and are aloof to close relationship after work, and I just unleash all your inner desire. Our love can transcend over the hackneyed plot in the movie and I hope it will never get hackneyed but always get updated with the flow of time. Our love, the first time is curiosity, the second time is deep, the third time is attachment, will it be platitudinous after many times? No, I never hope so as long as we try to make something that's not platitudinous. The banal songs will be beautiful when we sing it together, the banal movie will be special when we watch it together, and the banal places will be impressive when we come there together. The pale insipid wine become tasty when we clink glasses, the insipid lyrics will be graceful when we read it together, and the insipid fictional character is transformed into quite a character when listen to the same digitally recorded book. I guess we must have the antecedent in the ancient time. The mild dog is the forerunner of you, and the docile dog is the forerunner of me.
	- Uncle, you are the precursor of the rainstorm, accumulating strength in a murmur. You are the implausible rainbow hanging in the sky on a sunny day. You are the prudent woodcarver that carefully sculpts the facial details of every carved figure. You are the enigmatic smile of Mona Lisa that can always arouse my curiosity. You are the inscrutable expression of Einstein that is full of future predictions. You are an ordinary but extraordinary person who has to acquiesce to something or to comprise your integrity to earn a small salary. You are a calm wiser who is never gullible to liars. You are kind enough to help credulous people find their right path back. You are making good use of the seemingly futile things to become the least futile among your peers. You are indigenous people of my land so you could understand me so well. You are one of the endemic species growing on my embrace, you are one of the endemic crimes that happened on the street of my night dream, and you are one of the endemic diseases that can only be suffered in my heart. You are the ubiquitous memory that could be caught from the Xiao Mi bracelet, noise-canceling headphones, and a new wallet. You are the pandemic ballad that always lingers in my ears. You are the man with great fortitude bearing with the pain of poor material. You have the diminutive size among the northeastern population because of malnutrition. You are like the diminutive star in the vast starry sky who has a special charm. You are the weapon for me to fight the minutiae of life. You exhort me to organize my clothes and fold my tissues. You are like the four seasons reincarnation that I will never have an antipathy towards. You show little animosity for the bad influence of your original family. You show no rancor against innocent people who couldn't help you. You never digress from what you have planned to do and keep focused all the time. You left me yesterday, and I hope I could just hold on to your arm with a tenacious grip forever. But I know I cannot be indulgent in my selfness of monopolizing you with the flood of emotion. Polarizing love is not advisable, and I'm sure that any divisive topic could not separate us. Uncle, you are like the nebulous mist, sometimes very near and very clear, sometimes very far and very vague. Your love for me is always a nebulous concept but it's always so true. Good times are always fleeting, and I've been looking forward to the moment when we meet again.
	- Uncle, I hope nobody will add some finishing touches to our relationship.
