- However, boundary information can be wellharnessed  in  segmentation  problems.  [24],  [28]â€“[30]  employedges  to  improve  segmentation  performance  with  additionalbranch for boundary detection. While [31], [32] treat boundarypixels as hard samples and assign additional attention to thesehard  pixels  such  as  more  loss  functions  or  MLP  operations.

- rethe  two  tasks  are  learned  together  and  hence  benefit  eachother,  producing  the  explicit  boundary  map.  Moreover,  thisprocess  brings  little  extra  computation  cost  compared  withtwo  branches  method  from  previous  works,  and  we  can  usethe  predicted  boundary  map  for  further  feature  propagationdesign.
