	- 邮件能够从侧面反映出你的背景：有没有海外留学经验、有没有基本的英文文化圈常识、有没有connection
	- chatGPT能完成95%的文书工作了，几乎是无往而不利
	- 向上社交是要与 [陌生的] [地位比你高的] 人交流
		- 比如某些学院的高层领导
		- 中国学生的缺点是不知道如何准确地表达尊重
		  collapsed:: true
			- 中国文化里的尊重：
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693418544288_0.png)
				- 加上很多的敬语表示态度和懂礼貌，比如您好；称呼头衔时对方的头衔中哪个最大就叫什么，对方既是老师又是教授，那肯定称呼对方教授，如果人家还是副院长，那么就称呼是副院长
			- 英文文化里的尊重：
				- 我把情况交代清楚，然后把选择权交给对方
				- 案例版本1：
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693419460990_0.png)
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693420366370_0.png)
						- 对方可能会认为：难道这个岗位是你想申请就申请的吗？这个岗位这么不值钱的吗？
						- 不要经常用I作为主语开头
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693420565488_0.png)
						- 有点喧宾夺主了
						- 后面的资格的详细描述内容上没有太大问题，但是逻辑性欠缺，车轱辘话反复说，
				- 案例版本2：
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693421033685_0.png)
					- 内容方面欠缺，因为计算机系想要去给数学系的当助教，那么必须得拿出具有说服力的证据才行，要给对方一个足够合理的理由来接受你，比如这里申请助教可以说自己未来有读phd当教职的规划，想要提前体验一下教学的这种感觉
					- 内容上要有一种感人至深的感觉，但是不是卖惨或者是这里的“我很喜欢帮助它们的过程”这种类型的主观上的情感表达，而应该是一种客观上的表达，因为这种主观表达是一种主观需求，太弱了
					- 语言要尊重，还要委婉，委婉就是说要避免“I think” “I want” 这种特别主观的词
						- “我以为应该怎么怎么做”可以改成：“我已经尝试了三种方法，A方法是xxx，B方法xxx...结果，我想询问你，觉得应该做才是合适的呢？就我个人而言(as far as I know, as far as I understand）我觉得方法2应该是不错的”
					- 表达自己是qualified并不是“我很自信”的正确表达方式
				- 案例版本3：
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693421939514_0.png)
					- 在描述自己的情况下，适当捧高对方
					-
		- GPT使用：
		  collapsed:: true
			- 原文：
				- Please rephrase the following email：
					- i am XXX from the college of computer science and engineering. This year, i have finished the courses Math 1371 and Math 1372. am glad that i have a deep understanding for thestcourses and got the score of A for both of them at last. During this summer time, I want toapply for the undergraduate teaching assistant/grader pasition for Math 1271 or Math 1272.
					- i think I am quite qualified, apart from my deep understanding of these courses, it's also because I know how to deal with my peers and what kind of problems they might have. In the discussion class, I loved to talk with my peers and eaplain the questions they met. During the office hour, I tried to help my peers when our instructor/TA was occupied by other students.Under my explanation, they figured out the questions successfully: I am also enjoying the process of helping them.

				- 当然gpt也可能会存在一些问题：
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693424735556_0.png)
					- 改变提问gpt的方式可能可以解决，具体还是得看内容：
					  collapsed:: true
						- Please rephrase the following email using a modest and respectful attitude:
						- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693425089906_0.png)
						- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693425154948_0.png)
						- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693425185967_0.png)
						-
					- GPT的内容过于啰嗦了，且核心内容还是由我们自己来设计
