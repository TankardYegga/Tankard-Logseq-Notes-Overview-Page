	  *1) Cohesion and Coherence *
	  Cohesion can be thought of as all the *grammatical and lexical links(*词汇链接) that link one part of a text to another. This includes the use of synonyms(同义词), lexical sets(词汇集), pronouns(代词), verb tenses(动词时态), time references(时间参考), grammatical references, etc. For example, 'it', 'neither' and 'this' all refer to an idea previously mentioned. 'First of all, 'then' and 'after that' help to sequence a text. 'However', 'in addition' and 'for instance' link ideas and arguments in a text.   Coherence can be thought of as how meanings and sequences of ideas relate to each other. Typical examples would be general > particular; statement> example; problem> solution; question> answer; claim> counter-claim(反诉).  *2) What does cohesion mean?   *You might think of cohesion as a means of establishing connections within a text at all sorts of different levels, e.g., sections, paragraphs, sentences, and even phrases.   How is cohesion different from coherence? It is difficult to separate the two. However, think of coherence as the text making sense as a whole* at an ideas level,* and cohesion as rather more mechanical links *at a language level.* *You can imagine that it is possible for a piece of writing to contain plenty of cohesion yet little coherence.*   Cohesion is the glue that holds a piece of writing together. In other words, if a paper is cohesive, it sticks together from sentence to sentence and from paragraph to paragraph. *Cohesive devices* certainly include transitional words（过渡词） and phrases, such as therefore, furthermore, or for instance, that clarify for readers the relationships among ideas in a piece of writing. However, transitions aren't enough to make writing cohesive. Repetition of keywords and use of reference words are also needed for cohesion. 
	  
	  3）What does coherence mean?  
	  *When sentences, ideas, and details fit together clearly, readers can follow along easily, and the writing is coherent. The ideas tie together smoothly and clearly. To establish the links that readers need, you can use the methods listed here. *
	  
	  * *Repetition of a Key Term or Phrase  *This helps to focus your ideas and to keep your reader on track.
	  Example: The problem with contemporary art(当代艺术) is that it is not easily understood by most people. Contemporary art is deliberately abstract, and that means it leaves the viewer wondering what she is looking at. 
	  
	  
	  * *Synonyms(同义词）*Synonyms are words that have essentially the same meaning, and they provide some variety in your word choices, helping the reader to stay focused on the idea being discussed. * *Example: Myths narrate sacred histories and explain sacred origins. These traditional narratives are, in short, a set of beliefs that are a very real force in the lives of the people who tell them. （神话叙述神圣的历史并解释神圣 起源。简而言之，这些传统叙事是一套信念，在讲述这些东西的人的生活中是一种非常真实的力量。）
	  
	  
	  * *Pronouns  *This, that, these, those, he, she, it, they, and we are useful pronouns for referring back to something previously mentioned. Be sure, however, that what you are referring to is clear.  Example: When scientific experiments do not work out as expected, they are often considered failures until some other scientist tries them again. Those that work out better the second time around are the ones that promise the most rewards. （那些第二次试验结果更好的人是那些被承诺最多回报的人）
	  
	  
	  * *Transitional Words  *There are many words in English that cue（提示） our readers to relationships between sentences, joining sentences together. Words, however, therefore, in addition, also, but, such as “”“”“”“”“” moreover“, etc.  **Example: I like autumn, and yet autumn is a sad time of the year, too. The leaves turn bright shades of red and the weather is mild, but I can't help thinking ahead to the winter and the ice storms that will surely blow through here. In addition, that will be the season of chapped（皴, 裂开的） faces, too many layers of clothes to put on, and days when I'll have to shovel heaps of snow from my car's windshield.（树叶变成鲜艳的红色，天气温和，但我不禁想到冬天和肯定会吹过这里的冰暴。此外，那将是面部皲裂的季节，衣服层数太多，我不得不从汽车挡风玻璃上铲起成堆的雪。）
	  
	  
	  * *Sentence Patterns  Sometimes, repeated or parallel sentence patterns can help the reader follow along and keep ideas tied together. *
	  Example: (from a speech by President John F. Kennedy) And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country. 
	  
	  
	  4) Understanding of device
	  Cohesive Devices are words or phrases that show the relationship between paragraphs or sections of a text or speech.
	  
	  Cohesive devices are words like 'For example, 'In conclusion', 'however' and 'moreover'.

	  Coherence: When something such as a piece of writing is easy to understand because its parts are connected in a clear and reasonable way
	  Cohesion: if there is cohesion among a group of people, a set of ideas, etc, all the 
	  parts or members of it are connected or related in a reasonable way to form a whole
	  
	  Coherence: ideas are logical and well-organized: easy to understand 
	  Cohesive: ideas are closely united
	  https://www.zhihu.com/question/312490401/answer/722527450
	  两者都是为了行文流畅完整，都作为英语中衔接手段。
	  大概区别就是，coherence是指上下文内容和逻辑的连贯。如前因后果，铺垫等等。
	  cohesion则是通过一些代词、连接词等看得见的手段来使行文流畅完整。如firstly，secondly.../it等代词/moreover，in addition等

	  Nothing would conduce more to the unity of the nation. （没有什么可以更有助于民族的团结了）
	  
	  machine learning (ML) is a transformative technology that touches everything we do as a company. Therefore, fundamental advances in machine learning technology are likely to produce value across the organization, even when developed without a close connection to a specific application or product. ML is not unique in this regard; the same argument applies to other technologies outside of ML that are critical to the company.
	  
	  There are differences there but I don't think they can stand in your way of making good presentations. It may have smaller space but there should be good acoustic effects there. The walls are usually installed with sould insulation or sound absorbtion material so you may not feel so much echoing of your own voice while speaking. Years ago I used to judge groups of candidates for the contest by watching their video but I do not remember seeing  any mic or laser pointer equipped. I understand your worrry but never mind. For such possible changes of the details on the scene, as you said, you can go earlier to confirm and experience. And if you want to get more used to them I recommend that you rehearse by standing and speaking in a smaller classroom, turning off the speaker while pointing at anywhere on the screen with your finger, hands, pens or anything you feel comfortable about. Anyway, these are just minor exterior factors. The most important key is in your speech where you can represent good INTERACTIVE skills. Just relax and speak to the camera lens as if it became the patient and nice audience such as me and your friends in the class. Good luck everyone!

	  Ladies and gentlemen, and every distinguished guest:
	  
	  I am greatly honored to give the opening speech at this International Conference in Nanjing, China. On behalf of Southeast University, I am delighted to welcome all the scholars and guests from home and abroad. Thank you for all your participation.
	  
	  Would it be artificial intelligence or artificial disability? This is a typical argument recently, it's about whether the existing method has reached true intelligence. See the first picture here, an automatic driving car keeps running in a circle, because the algorithm behind tries to achieve zero-collision, professionally to be claimed overfitting that cannot generalize well to the real world; and in the last picture, an intelligent translation tool made a mistake of translating the destroying operation of the drugs into selling.
	  
	  So you see enormous challenges are still facing us. This conference launched today is attempting to explore possible solutions with multiple frontier technologies colliding together, including natural language processing, data mining, social computing, and knowledge engineering.
	  
	  Finally, I wish you a nice stay and a safe trip in Nanjing. Now I would like to conclude my speech by declaring the conference open and wishing it a complete success
	  
	  A simple mixture of methodologies will not make a thing, but a deep understanding of the essence will do. Thank you for all the sharings today, that's definitely going to push the AI research further. Now I declare the conference a successful conclusion.

	  How glamorous the city is!
	  
	  Money can be touchy subject敏感的话题.
	  
	  The rent is really sky high in manhattan.The median room for one bedroom apartment in New York is three thousand one hundred and fifty dollars.
	  
	  There's a gym on the rooftop of my airbnb.
	  I haven't pay the full price because i got a coupon优惠券.
	  
	  I bought a long-term stay in airbnb (租房软件)but the host canceled on me last minute that really caused me a lot of hassel(麻烦) so this was the compensation I receive from the airbnb aside from my refund.(是除了退款以外的其他补偿)
	  
	  I bought a monthly unlimited metro card(无线地铁卡) which cost 127 that's $31.75.
	  
	  Let us get into our daily spendings.
	  
	  I started doing a live stream (现场直播)
	  
	  I went and grab my favorite snacks and it was pretty filling.
	  
	  I got a hat that i really adore.我得到了一顶我非常喜欢的帽子
	  
	  It was kind of conversation starter.它是某种对话的开始
	  
	  This video is an investment piece and i got a lot of compliments.
	  
	  I grew to like it after a few weeks i think the necklace looks really good pairing with another chain.
	  
	  I ate the short ribs from trader joe.
	  我从joe那里吃到了排骨
	  
	  Pizza is something I have been craving for a while. 我期望了很久
	  
	  The shroom burger is a good choice for vegetarians.
	  
	  I am a sucker for local brew beer. 我喜欢当地酿造的啤酒
	  
	  You are a sucker! You just believed in him! (*a person who believes everything they are told and is , therefore, is easy to deceive)你是傻子*
	  
	  I didn't go to Broadway because I am not into that musicals. 因为我不是那种音乐人.
	  
	  I reserved two seats at a show for both you and me.我预定了两个座位.
	  
	  That's way more than I expected.这比我想象得多得多
	  
	  Honestly, in hindsight(事后看来)  I just made the right decision to quit my job. 
	  
	  I think I literally laugh to tears.
	  
	  Overall the verdict (判决是） is new york is fun to visit but I really don't see myself living here long term unless the connections you make in the city help your career. I don't see how anyone can justify the price. 不过这里的物价真的难以让人接受.

	  There is more to California than just movie stars and Disneyland. This is a state boasting a lot of stunning natural attractions, including beautiful beaches, serene deserts(宁静的沙滩）and majestic mountains(雄伟的山峰）. California is also home to a number of exciting cities, charming towns, and to some of the world's best wineries. An overview of the best places to visit California:
	  
	  * The area is a magnet/attraction for travels on road trips, who were attracted by the towering (高耸的）redwood trees and breathtaking beaches along the route. More than just the beautiful scenery of driving through, the area also provides plenty of top hiking opportunities which wind their way through the several state parks encompassed by (被环绕）Big Sur.
	  
	  * Catalina Island： a favorite day trip for visitors to L.A. as well as a popular vacation and honeymoon spot.
	  
	  * Lake Tahoe: the freshwater lake straddles California and Nevada and is a top destination year round（一整年）.
	  
	  * Sequoia and Kings Canyon NP: Interesting enough, it boasts the deepest canyon（峡谷） in America.
	  
	  * Napa Valley: the premier destination(首选目的地） for wine lovers in the United States; camping ground（露营地） available for those interested in saving a little money on lodging; world-class spa where visitors can be pampered and enjoy a variety of fun activities, including hot air balloon rides and guided bike wine tours.
	  
	  * San Diego: fabulous beaches and ideal climate; the upscale （高档的） neighborhood of beaches
	  
	  * Death Valley: from snow-capped mountains to colorFul sand dunes（沙丘）, the unique desert landscapes of Death Valley are like no other place in California; Places of interest include the scenic vista of Zabriskie Point and historical sites like ruins of ghost towns and Scotty's Castle.
	  
	  * Los Angeles: the city of Angels
	  
	  * Yosemite NP
	  
	  * San Francisco: the Golden Gate suspension bridge
	  
	  
	  Being a Californian. The best way to put it is you go up North/East for Mountains and snow, you go South for heat and deserts, go West for beaches and wind.

	  I want to take some time off. I'm really tired of the successive hard work.
	  
	  I'm reluctant to work overtime.
	  
	  Please give me enough notice if you are going to take a long unpaid leave.
	  
	  I was just hoping that I might be able to take a leave of absence. (stay away from work for a long period of time, without getting paid)
	  
	  Our company sets up maternity leave for a mother to care for their new babies.
	  
	  Has your company taken away your bank holiday(public holiday recognized by law (BrE))? They are never allowed to deprive you of normal rights.
	  
	  Boss, do you have a second/minute/sec? I want to ask for personal leave (time away from work for personal reasons (i.e. doctor’s appointment, etc.)), in which case I have to pick up my little boy.
	  
	  My mom will make it up to me by buying a video game.
	  I will make it up to my mom with a bunch of flowers.
	  
	  I was just wondering, could you give me a ride?
	  
	  What dates are you going to plan on dating her?
	  
	  Even though you have used up all your vacation days this year, sick leave is still permitted.
	  
	  They were relieved that the 2021 economic recession was not happening.
	  I am relieved that I am not infected with the virus by taking that bus.
	  She's relieved to stop a murder which is gonna committed by his impulsive brother.
	  I'm relieved to see you again. I am worried that something bad happened to you.
	  ( relaxed and happy that something difficult has been stopped )
	  
	  I missed a plane that crashed halfway. That's a twist of fate.
	  (unplanned events that have a big impact on the future)
	  A twist of fate brought us together.
	  
	  I feel just awful about this whole thing.
	  
	  Let me take you out to dinner, Linda.
	  
	  I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day, but I was wrong.
	  
	  I crashed into your life and you into mine, and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you.
	  
	  Does Jack ask you out once?
	  
	  This is a great way to capture the important moments in your life—big and small—every single day
	  
	  I'd like to find a book inspiring me to get up at the crack of dawn.
	  
	  I know how best to use some of these tools.
	  
	  Sorry, but this product was flagged for removal.
	  
	  We might do sth to our overall happiness.
	  
	  When I felt nervous, I would fiddle with my pen.
	  
	  With a civil war, the country has been a turmoil for ten years.
	  (a state of confusion, disorder, disturbance)
	  There has been a lot of turmoils in my life. I moved to a new city, changed my job, and broke up with my girlfriend.
	  The devaluation of the dollar caused a great deal of turmoil in the market.
	  
	  Mom, I wanna hit you up for some cash, dad just refused me.
	  
	  China is a nation undergoing quick industrialization, thus we can call it is an emerging market.
	  
	  Which emerging market do you think will promise great returns?
	  
	  As a poor, I want to enter the mid-class.
	  
	  Fine, then! If that's the way you feel, so be it.
	  
	  She was losing out on such a good opportunity of financial independence, for she just resigned from a company that is to be listed on NYSE.
	  
	  Come on, son, you just look at getting into the market too naively, because the market always exhibits a great deal of instability.
	  
	  Oh, my gosh! The American currency just devalued by a whole percentage point!
	  
	  I wouldn't feel comfortable investing in that climate.
	  
	  I wouldn't feel easy studying that problem.
	  
	  We have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the company.
	  
	  Here alone, the aggregate demand(总需求） for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.
	  
	  This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.
	  （money that is saved to pay for something in the future, usually a house, or retirement）
	  
	  Some provisions should be made for the depreciation of fixed assets.
	  应当为固定资产的折旧指定一些规定。

	  We have to do sth to stop transmitting diseases to each other.
	  
	  Influenza is normal.
	  
	  So, what I'd like to do is:.....
	  
	  What a big supper! I'm total stuffed.
	  
	  I'm going to cut out all that junk I eat.
	  I'm going to cut out anything else from my life. I have to focus on my work.
	  
	  Are you going to totally transform your eating habits?
