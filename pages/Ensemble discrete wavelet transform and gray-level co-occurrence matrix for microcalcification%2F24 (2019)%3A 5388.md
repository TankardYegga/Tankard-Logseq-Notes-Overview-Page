title:: Ensemble discrete wavelet transform and gray-level co-occurrence matrix for microcalcification/24 (2019): 5388

- Microcalcifications in mammograms are an important early sign of breast cancer and their early detection is very important to improve its diagnosis. Many times microcalcification clusters are missed by radiologists due to its small size. Computer-based detection system can assist the radiologist to improve diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an approach for detection and classification of microcalcifications in digital mammograms. Given that the microcalcifications correspond to high-frequency components of the image spectrum, detection of microcalcifications is achieved by decomposing the mammograms into different frequency subbands using wavelet transform, scaling the high frequency sub-band and finally, reconstructing the mammogram using scaled high frequency sub-band. Classification of microcalcifications into benign and malignant classes is done using wavelet features and two
  types of classifiers, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network Classifier. Classification accuracy achieved with Artificial Neural Network Classifier is 96.15% which is
  greater than that with Support Vector Machine Classifier.
- 乳房X光检查中的微小钙化是乳腺癌的一个重要的早期征兆，其早期检测对于提高乳腺癌的诊断是非常重要的。很多时候，微钙化群由于体积小而被放射科医生所遗漏。基于计算机的检测系统可以帮助放射医师提高诊断的准确性。本文提出了一种检测和分类数字乳房X光片中微钙化的方法。鉴于微钙化对应于图像频谱的高频成分，微钙化的检测是通过使用小波变换将乳房X光片分解成不同的频率子带，对高频子带进行缩放，最后使用缩放的高频子带重建乳房X光片来实现。使用小波特征和两种类型的分类器，即支持向量分类器，将微钙化分为良性和恶性两类。支持向量机和人工神经网络分类器这两种类型的分类器。人工神经网络分类器的分类准确率为96.15%，高于支持向量机分类器。比支持向量机分类器的准确率高。
