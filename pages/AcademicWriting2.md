		- 将项目设置在户外环境下的具体方法
			- 让孩子在自然环境下感觉到舒适
			- 给孩子时间去交流关于自然的感受
			- 自由选择简单的活动去进行学习
			- 增加孩子与包括老师在内的成人之间的社交活动
		- 将项目设置在户外环境下的理由
			- 有机会直接与自然环境接触能够：【1】增加对环境的正面感受【2】促进它们对自然有机物的兴趣
			- 老师与学生的共有经历能够：将户外和教室内的科学联系起来
	- 用于增强自然连接的干预是如何影响孩子们对校内科学的兴趣的？

		- 结论：
			- 干预组中增加的学科兴趣分  支持了 “干预增加兴趣”的观点
			- 干预组有限的样本数量 导致 这一结论的统计学意义不明显
		- 原因分析：
			- 拓展了孩子关于科学能够做什么的视野
			- 帮助老师建立了教学和实践的连接
			- 一部分同学能够在这样一个被老师和同学鼓励支持的环境下，分享并展示出来他们对科学的潜在兴趣
			- 关于自然感受的讨论改变了他们关于自身与环境关系的认识
			- 环境认同部分由对于自然世界的感受决定，早期的环境认同对于保持对科学的长期兴趣至关重要

- Conclusion ：
	- The paper has demonstrated the concrete mechanism of how positive interventions contribute to the enhancement of environmental identities and how the strengthened natural connection has an influence on children's interest growth in school science. The supporting data of the conclusion comes from a program which had a group of 5th-grade students participate in activities designed by different strategies.
	- As for the positive interventions, transferring the activity space from campus to outdoor places was the first priority, and abound measures subsequently designed were seen as the overall second, which incorporated creating a natural environment comforting the kids more,  encouraging delivery on feelings about nature, providing simple learning activities for free selection, and facilitating social contact between children and adults. The reason why the method works well lied in two aspects: healthy feedback and intense interest were able to be inspired by direct nature immersion; the combination of school science with outdoor practices was allowed for teachers on the basis of common experiences.
	- A statistically unobvious conclusion can be deduced from the increased mean interest score within the limited samples: the aforementioned interventions managed to boost the development of children's interest in school science. The rationale behind this could be laid out in 5 perspectives: the exploration process into the natural world enlarged students' vision of what school science could achieve; the link between classroom theories and outdoors experiences was built to be an aid of science teaching; the deeply hidden interest in science was able to be exposed in such an environment where the appreciation was more and the peer pressure was less; the debating over feelings reshaped children’s thinking on how to better relate themselves to the nature; the environmental identities acquired in the early stage of life played a crucial role in the long term perseverance of the love for science.
	- One limitation of the study was the unobvious statistical significance caused by the small size of the invention group and the low frequency of visits.
	- The research hoped to promote these strategies already found in the program and discover more effective methods in further research
