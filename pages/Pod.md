	  I want to take some time off. I'm really tired of the successive hard work.
	  
	  I'm reluctant to work overtime.
	  
	  Please give me enough notice if you are going to take a long unpaid leave.
	  
	  I was just hoping that I might be able to take a leave of absence. (stay away from work for a long period of time, without getting paid)
	  
	  Our company sets up maternity leave for a mother to care for their new babies.
	  
	  Has your company taken away your bank holiday(public holiday recognized by law (BrE))? They are never allowed to deprive you of normal rights.
	  
	  Boss, do you have a second/minute/sec? I want to ask for personal leave (time away from work for personal reasons (i.e. doctor’s appointment, etc.)), in which case I have to pick up my little boy.
	  
	  My mom will make it up to me by buying a video game.
	  I will make it up to my mom with a bunch of flowers.
	  
	  I was just wondering, could you give me a ride?
	  
	  What dates are you going to plan on dating her?
	  
	  Even though you have used up all your vacation days this year, sick leave is still permitted.
	  
	  They were relieved that the 2021 economic recession was not happening.
	  I am relieved that I am not infected with the virus by taking that bus.
	  She's relieved to stop a murder which is gonna committed by his impulsive brother.
	  I'm relieved to see you again. I am worried that something bad happened to you.
	  ( relaxed and happy that something difficult has been stopped )
	  
	  I missed a plane that crashed halfway. That's a twist of fate.
	  (unplanned events that have a big impact on the future)
	  A twist of fate brought us together.
	  
	  I feel just awful about this whole thing.
	  
	  Let me take you out to dinner, Linda.
	  
	  I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day, but I was wrong.
	  
	  I crashed into your life and you into mine, and this may sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you.
	  
	  Does Jack ask you out once?
	  
	  This is a great way to capture the important moments in your life—big and small—every single day
	  
	  I'd like to find a book inspiring me to get up at the crack of dawn.
	  
	  I know how best to use some of these tools.
	  
	  Sorry, but this product was flagged for removal.
	  
	  We might do sth to our overall happiness.
	  
	  When I felt nervous, I would fiddle with my pen.
	  
	  With a civil war, the country has been a turmoil for ten years.
	  (a state of confusion, disorder, disturbance)
	  There has been a lot of turmoils in my life. I moved to a new city, changed my job, and broke up with my girlfriend.
	  The devaluation of the dollar caused a great deal of turmoil in the market.
	  
	  Mom, I wanna hit you up for some cash, dad just refused me.
	  
	  China is a nation undergoing quick industrialization, thus we can call it is an emerging market.
	  
	  Which emerging market do you think will promise great returns?
	  
	  As a poor, I want to enter the mid-class.
	  
	  Fine, then! If that's the way you feel, so be it.
	  
	  She was losing out on such a good opportunity of financial independence, for she just resigned from a company that is to be listed on NYSE.
	  
	  Come on, son, you just look at getting into the market too naively, because the market always exhibits a great deal of instability.
	  
	  Oh, my gosh! The American currency just devalued by a whole percentage point!
	  
	  I wouldn't feel comfortable investing in that climate.
	  
	  I wouldn't feel easy studying that problem.
	  
	  We have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the company.
	  
	  Here alone, the aggregate demand(总需求） for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth-generating opportunity.
	  
	  This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.
	  （money that is saved to pay for something in the future, usually a house, or retirement）
	  
	  Some provisions should be made for the depreciation of fixed assets.
	  应当为固定资产的折旧指定一些规定。

	  We have to do sth to stop transmitting diseases to each other.
	  
	  Influenza is normal.
	  
	  So, what I'd like to do is:.....
	  
	  What a big supper! I'm total stuffed.
	  
	  I'm going to cut out all that junk I eat.
