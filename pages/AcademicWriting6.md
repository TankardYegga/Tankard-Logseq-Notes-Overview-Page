- good morning. I am Liuwen Zou. I am responsible for the first part of the  Method section that is about data collection. It took me four steps to wall through the procedure of data collection.  The first step is to identify the research subject,  which refers to all graduate students in southeast university in our case.  Two reasons here can account for the choice, they are more available and enable a faster speed of collecting; there is more possibility for them to give reliable answers. For the second step, two tools were employed to perform the data collection.  The first tool is online questionnaire,  the design, the revision and the production and distribution are three aspects .   We combined literature sources and ready made templates to form the the four dimensions to be considered,  they are demographic variables, perceived risk, perceived convenience, and usage experience.  The revision was examined by 10 master students to provide great feedbacks.  The sheet was produced by a tool website  and the distribution was  aided by the snowball effect of social networks. By the way, we have a clear division of labor in the three aspects. After that, we process the data. For the questionnaire results,  just remove irrelevant ones manually; for the manuscripts, we select those with enlightening value. And finally, I drafted this section with my writing schema. I wrote the overview of the method. I carefully use simple past tense passive voice and sequential marker.
